#### *artist, consultant, cyclist, designer, musician, photographer, world traveller*

I live in Sydney, and love cycling, photography, music, and travel (not necessarily in that order).
Lately I have been learning how to design and code.

This website is writen in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) based on the
[Cara](https://cara.lekoarts.de) theme by [LekoArts](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/).
The source code for this website is available on
[Github](https://github.com/ChristineTham/gatsby-blog) and it is hosted on
Gastby.

The websites featured on this page have been written in a mixture of React,
NextJS and Wordpress (using my own Genesis child themes).

I am available for work should you wish to hire me.
